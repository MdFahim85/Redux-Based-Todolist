Redux Based TodoList

This is a Todo List application built using React and Redux Toolkit for robust state management. It allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks, with real-time updates powered by Redux. All tasks are stored in localStorage, so your todos persist even after refreshing the page. The app also features a dynamic filtering system to view all, completed, or incomplete tasks based on user preference. Tailwind CSS is used for styling the UI, and the project demonstrates a clean architecture with reusable components and clear separation of concerns.
